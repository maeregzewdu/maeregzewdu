- Learning more about Laravel, Vue, and the whole process of actually shipping products

## A bit about me
I just wrapped up my matric exams and went straight into working on my company full-time.  
Most of my days are a mix of coding, pitching, and figuring things out as I go.  
Iâ€™m big on self-improvement and try to push myself in fitness and productivity.
